    <h1> Welcome to my Website</h1>
    <h2> Hello, </h2>
    <p> My name is Tina Shabestari. I graduated from  Handsworth Secondary Highschool in 2018.
        I got accepted into the Science Program at Capilano University.
        After two years of studying at Capilano University, I realized my <em> passion</em> has always been for computer science; 
        therefore, I applied for the British Columbia Technology Institute (BCIT) for the Computer Information Technology program.
    </p>
    <p> At the moment I am taking seven courses in the CIT program but the most important courses are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Database Systems </li>
         <li> Scripting for IT</li> 
         <li> <a title = "Fundemental Web Technolgies" href= "https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20211084967/">  Fundemental Web Technolgies BCIT Site </a></li>
    </ul>

    <p> During the past few summers, I worked in a dental office using a unified dental practice management software (Cleardent) to enter the patient's information and book appointments.
        Sometimes I have to challenge myself to solve the problems that I encountered during my work with the software, which made me more interested in the computer science program. 
        I live in North Vancouver with my parents in a two-bedroom Condo. I have a small bedroom with an IKEA desk table where I have set up my PC Laptop.
        I like to read novels, watch movies, explore BC nature sites, and go to the gym in my spare time.
